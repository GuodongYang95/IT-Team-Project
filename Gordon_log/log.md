    Based on MVC structure, a package named view was created with a CommonLineView class in it.
    The CommonLineView class contains the following methods:

        1. gameOrStatstics() //The view of asking user whether playing a game or showing the past game statistics
   
        2. numOfAi() //The view of asking user to choose how many AI players 


        3. statstics() //The view of past game statistics


        4. roundStart() //The view of the round started


        5. selectCategory() //The view of game results 


        6. endGame() //The view of displaying players' final score
